<p align="center">
A module for FoundryVTT that includes over 600 fantasy plants from Broderick's Compendium: Plants and Fungi Across the Realm. 
</p>

## Features
- Adds over 600 plants with automation
- Creates roll tables for 12 biomes for players to search
- Automates a loot actor containing found plants

## Disclaimer
- I did not create any of the plants (at this point)
- Plants source: <https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/83oupp/brodericks_compendium_plants_and_fungi_across_the/>


## Installation

**Method 1:**

- Start Foundry and head to the Add-on Modules tab.
- Click Install Module.
- Search for "Broderick's Compendium" or "Plants" or "Fungi"
- Click the install button when it comes up.

**Method 2:**

- Start Foundry and head to the Add-on Modules tab.
- Click Install Module.
- Paste the following link into the "Manifest URL" field at the
  bottom: <https://github.com/mluvisi16/brodericks-compendium-plants-fungi/releases/latest/download/module.json>
- Click Install

## What's to come?

- Add images for plants that lack them
- Add PF2E Support
- Add in game uses for some of the plants lacking a distinct usecase in game
- Update visual description of some plants that have a use, but no description
- Automate the foraging/crafting likely through integration with the suggested use section modules

## Optional Dependencies

- TBD once I have automation and content finished for all plants

## Suggested Use

- I am planning to use this with TheRipper93s [Gatherer](https://theripper93.com/module/gatherer) and [Mastercrafted](https://theripper93.com/module/mastercrafted)
- I will be creating another module for animal/monster parts as well as non plant/fungi reagents and potions specifically for integration with this and the above modules.

## Wait a minute... I've already seen this!

This module is a fork of the wonderful [FoundryVTT-FantasyPlants](https://github.com/KyleBishop/FoundryVTT-FantasyPlants) module by Kyle Bishop, but has since received a ton of updates by Marc Straub and his amazing updates to this module for v10 [foundryvtt-brodericks-compendium](https://github.com/marcstraube/foundryvtt-brodericks-compendium) including the following

- Cleaned-up CSS on item descriptions.
- Icons for all plants missing pictures
- Every plant description contains the biomes where to find it.
- Some already legendary plants get an additional info, if they are "Exceedingly Rare".
- Rebalanced roll tables.
- Compatibility for the new rarity setting, which got introduced by the DND5E 1.4.0 system.
- and more

## Support
