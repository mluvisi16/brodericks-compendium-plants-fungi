A module for FoundryVTT that includes over 600 fantasy plants from Broderick's Compendium: Plants and Fungi Across the
Realm (version 2.0)
(Source: <https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/83oupp/brodericks_compendium_plants_and_fungi_across_the/>).
I did not create any of the plants. This addon includes rolltables for the following regions as per the source material:

* Arctic
* City
* Coastal
* Desert
* Forest
* Jungle
* Mountain
* Ocean
* Plains
* River
* Swamp
* Underdark & Cave

Roll tables and plants are included as compendiums. Open up the roll table and select the region type your party is
searching in. Results will be added to a "Found Plants" loot actor for distribution to the players.

## Wait a minute... I've already seen this!

This module is a fork of the wonderful [FoundryVTT-FantasyPlants](https://github.com/KyleBishop/FoundryVTT-FantasyPlants) module by Kyle Bishop, but has since received a ton of updates by Marc Straub and his wonderful updates to this module for v10 [foundryvtt-brodericks-compendium](https://github.com/marcstraube/foundryvtt-brodericks-compendium) including the following

* Cleaned-up CSS on item descriptions.
* Picture or icon for every plant.
* Every plant description contains the biomes where to find it.
* Some already legendary plants get an additional info, if they are "Exceedingly Rare".
* Rebalanced roll tables.
* Compatibility for the new rarity setting, which got introduced by the DND5E 1.4.0 system.
* and more

## Installation

**Method 1:**

* Start Foundry and head to the Add-on Modules tab.
* Click Install Module.
* Search for "Broderick's Compendium" or "Plants" or "Fungi"
* Click the install button when it comes up.

**Method 2:**

* Start Foundry and head to the Add-on Modules tab.
* Click Install Module.
* Paste the following link into the "Manifest URL" field at the
  bottom: <https://github.com/mluvisi16/brodericks-compendium-plants-fungi/releases/latest/download/module.json>
* Click Install

## Optional Dependencies

Install [Better Rolltables](https://github.com/ultrakorne/better-rolltables) and [Loot Sheet NPC 5E](https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-loot-sheet-npc-5e) for enhanced functionality.

Install [Compendium Themer](https://github.com/p4535992/foundryvtt-compendium-themer) to custom style the compendiums. 

Install [libChangelog](https://github.com/theripper93/libChangelogs) to see a changelog with every module update.

## Suggested Use

* I am planning to use this with TheRipper93s [Gatherer](https://theripper93.com/module/gatherer) and [Mastercrafted](https://theripper93.com/module/mastercrafted)
* I will be creating another module for animal/monster parts as well as non plant/fungi reagents and potions specifically for integration with this and the above modules.

## What's to come?

* Add images for the 600+ plants/fungi that lack them
* Add in game uses for some of the plants lacking a distinct usecase in game
* Update visual description of some plants that have a use, but no description
* Automate the foraging/crafting likely through integration with the suggested use section modules
* Add more plants, get a followup module going for animal/monster parts and potion crafting.

Feel free to visit my repo or message me on discord "vitamorte" to report issues or create suggestions for future content or plant updates.
Enjoy your wilderness foraging!
